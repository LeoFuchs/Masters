Abstract-In this paper, we present two contributions to false
data injection attacks and mitigation in electric power systems.
First, we introduce a method of creating unobservable attacks on
the AC power flow equations. The attack strategy details how an
adversary can launch a stealthy attack to achieve a goal. Then, we
introduce a proactive defense strategy that is capable of detecting
attacks. The defense strategy introduces known perturbations by
deliberately probing the system in a specific, structured manner.
We show that the proposed approach, under certain conditions,
is able to detect the presence of false data injection attacks, as
well the attack locations and information about the manipulated
data values.
I. INTRODUCTION
False data injection attacks in the power grid have recently
begun to attract wide-spread interest. The role of data in power
systems analysis, and hence the importance of studying false
data injection attacks, is understood by considering the data
pipeline from the measurement devices in the field to the pointof-end-use
applications. Devices such as relays and remote
terminal units (RTUs) perform the physical data acquisition
and are connected through a Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition (SCADA) system. Communication networks then
transmit this data which is ultimately processed by power
applications, such as those in an energy management system
(EMS) at a control center. A taxonomy of dependencies
between the communications and the physical power infrastructures
is given in [1].
At the application level, maliciously injected data can be
a serious threat. The problem, from an operational reliability
standpoint [2], [3], arises when the operator sees the effects
of the injected false data (what the attacker wants him or
her to see), yet is unaware that there is anything wrong. The
operator is then in a position where he or she is unknowingly
making decisions and taking control actions based on the false
state of the system [4], [5], [6]. The importance of situational
awareness is explicitly revealed in the reports of investigations
following the August 14, 2003 blackout [7] and the more
recent southwest outage [8].
A necessary enabler of designing protection and detection
mechanisms is the ability to sufficiently characterize how
attacks might look in a real power system and how they might
be achieved from a practical standpoint.
In [9], a probing approach is proposed for detecting false
data injection attacks. The approach relies on perturbing the
power system by leveraging D-FACTS devices to change the

impedance on a set of chosen lines in order to create observable
changes in the system, which an adversary is unable to
anticipate. The level of perturbation needed to thwart attacks
and the deviation from optimal caused by the perturbations
were also investigated.
This work builds upon [9] in two directions. First, we
introduce a simple algorithm for creating targeted unobservable
false data injection attacks based on the AC power
flow equations. Secondly, we introduce a perturbation-based
detection strategy and show its ability to identify false data
injection attacks by utilizing the value of data over time
(i.e., incorporating information from multiple snapshots).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
provides a brief background on false data injection attacks,
with specific focus on unobservable attacks. A method of
creating unobservable false data injection attacks based on the
AC power flow equations is presented in Section III. The attack
assumes the adversary has control over a limited set of meters.
Furthermore, the adversary needs only local information to
achieve the attack. Then, in Section IV, we formulate an
intentional perturbation (probing) strategy for attack detection.
The result is that by enacting a sequence of probes, it becomes
possible under certain conditions to detect that an attack is
occurring, identify which meters are involved, and identify
changes in injected data values.

A. Stealth Attacks
Unobservable or stealth attacks can be defined as data
injection attacks which completely satisfy the system model
equations. Thus, the observed measurements raise no alarms.
For this to be possible in the power grid, it means that multiple
solutions that satisfy the equations must exist for the system.
Power systems are nonlinear systems which may have multiple
or no solutions. The adversary must be able to compute (and
inject) one of the solutions that is different from the true
solution of the actual system. The surface of solutions for
the DC power flow model follows a linear mapping, and this
solution space has been fairly well characterized and explored
in the literature (e.g., [10], [11], [12]).
Due to their adherence to the power system measurement
model equations, unobservable attacks are a notably severe
class of false data injection attack. Typical residual-based bad
data detection is not sufficient against stealth attacks.
A useful characterization of stealth attacks is provided in
[11], where the general formulation can be summarized as an
optimization problem to minimize the p-norm of an attack
vector a such that the attack satisfies a set of goals and
such that the attack is unobservable. This way of expressing
the problem is general enough to encompass the false data
injection attacks of interest.
In particular, in equation (1), repeated from [11], it is
assumed that the attacker knows the measurement model
H, the attacker wishes to find an attack vector a such that
a 2 Im(H) (the attack is stealthy at a linearized level), and
the attack is to satisfy a set of goals (a 2 G ).

More recently, [13] extends the characterization of unobservable
attacks, expanding on the work in [14]. In particular,
[14] characterizes the relationship between power system observability
(i.e. the ability to estimate the state from a given set
of measurements) and coordinated false data injection attack
detectability. This concept, the basic correlation between state
observability and attack detectability underlies the foundation
of the entire notion of unobservable attacks that has developed
into a topic of great interest to both the cyber and power
communities.
Teixeira et. al. [15] arrive at an interesting practical result
which is that under certain conditions, when attack vectors
are chosen based on a linearized power flow model, (i.e. the
DC model), and the attacks are chosen in accordance with a
particular goal, the attack will succeed and be unobservable
to a state estimator. The authors show this experimentally
using the state estimator in MATPOWER [16], a toolbox for
MATLAB. The unobservability of the attacks may hold even
as the scaling of the attack vector is significantly increased.
More recently, Jia et. al. [17] demonstrate that unobservable
attacks designed for the linear model are not necessarily
effective when applied to a nonlinear system. The work
compels the need to study attacks designed specifically for
the nonlinear AC power flow equations and move away from
the potentially misleading DC simplifications. Coincidentally,
then, [17] provides motivation for the AC attacks presented in
this paper.
Many countermeasures to false data injection attacks have
been proposed (e.g., [14], [10], [13], [9]) in the literature.
While most such defenses rely on leveraging power sensor
information, [18] fuses cyber intrusion detection system (IDS)
alerts and power system measurements to detect false data
injection and identify modified measurements.
As the grid becomes more 'intelligent' and more potential
vulnerabilities are introduced, concerns regarding false data
injection and their analysis will only grow more prominent.
Thus, being able to model, study, and analyze false data injection
attacks to understand the repercussions in a real system
is of paramount importance. It remains an open question to
ascertain the extent to which the threat of these attacks is real
versus how much is perceived.
This work is a step towards providing an answer to that
question. A better understanding of the attack space helps us
as the defenders of the power grid work towards providing
appropriate mitigation strategies based on the determined
threat level and based on the characteristics, or signatures, of
the types of attacks deemed of interest to pursue.
An advantage that the defenders of the system can expect is
that the attacker has limited resources (access to meter data),
whereas we can access measurements (even though they might
be bad measurements) and control devices anywhere on the
system.
III. POWER FLOW ATTACKS
This work extends [9] which alludes to the presence of the
attacks described in this paper but does not actually present
them. In [9], we merely assume that such attacks are possible.
In the TCIPG testbed [19], we were able to demonstrate the
attacks developed in this paper. This section provides the
mathematical background and basis for the attacks.
Algorithm 1 summarizes the steps of the attack power
flow. The attack power flow provides a recipe for a malicious
intruder to modify measurements such that power balance is
still satisfied. Such attacks are inherently unobservable in the
AC power system model.
A. AC Power Flow Solution
The objective of the standard power flow problem is to
solve for the state of the system such that the system satisfies
real and reactive power balance. The power injected into each
bus by aggregate generation and load must equal the power
withdrawn by any connected lines and shunts. Solution of
these equations is a well-known and well-studied nonlinear
problem [20], [21]. Real and reactive power flows depend
on the state, the voltage magnitude and angle, yet the state
is unknown and must be found such that power balance
is satisfied throughout the system. The power flow solution
enforces the conservation of power.

where (6) is zero at solution and where the system admittance
matrix is defined as Ybus = G + jB [21].
The power flow problem may be written succinctly as
fpq(s ;V) = 0
where finding its solution is at the heart of most power systems
analysis. Its solution is typically found using the NewtonRaphson
method, an iterative technique that requires multiple
evaluations and factorizations of a large sparse matrix of
sensitivities, the Jacobian matrix J.
B. Slack, PV, and PQ buses
The above discussion is somewhat simplified and ignores
a few details which are important to talk about here to help
explain our attack recipe in the next section.
Consider that the only unknowns in the power flow equations
might not be the system state, s ;V. Often, load buses
are represented in the power flow solution by constant power
terms P and Q and are referred to as P Q buses. Generator
buses often have voltage regulation to maintain some terminal
voltage, Vspec. Thus, they are modeled as constant P and
constant V buses, called P V buses. For P V buses, the voltage
angle must still be solved for, but rather than solve for V
which is specified, we solve for its Q such that the desired
V is obtained. One bus is designated the slack or the swing
bus. This accounts for the fact that absolute angles are not
meaningful. Everywhere in the power flow equations, what
actually appear are always only angle differences. Angles are
only meaningful with respect to a reference.
The slack bus is the bus which serves as an angle reference.
In practice, the slack bus is chosen to be a large generator bus
and its state variables and V are fixed values in the power
flow. Its P and Q values are computed only after the power
flow solution is complete. Hence, the slack bus gets its name
because it picks up the slack or the losses of the system. Line
Let V be the vector of voltage magnitudes and be
the vector of voltage angles. The vector of real power net
injections (generation minus load at each bus) is P and the
vector of reactive power net injections is Q. Each bus thus
has four quantities: Vi, i, Pi, and Qi.
The power flow finds the set of voltages and angles that
satisfy the conservation of power for a given set of net power
injections at the buses. The system state s may be written as
s ;V = [ ; V]T, and the power flow or the power balance
equations are given by the following:

losses act as an unspecified load, where the value of the losses
are not known until after solution for the state s ;V.
C. Attack Power Flow Recipe
The attack power flow solution determines the data injections
needed to achieve a target while satisfying the underlying
system model (power balance) and therefore making the attack
unobservable.
In some ways, the attack power flow is the reverse of
the normal power flow. The normal power flow designates
one slack bus and solves for the states at all other buses.
By contrast, the attack power flow assumes that states at
all unmodifiable buses are fixed and solves for the value
modifications necessary to make that true.
To perform an attack, we set all of the unmodifiable states
to be fixed V buses. This holds V and fixed at that
bus. The f or loops (see lines 7 and 17) in Algorithm 1
calculate real and reactive power mismatch between injected
and withdrawn power at a node. The mismatch is used in each
Newton-Raphson iteration to update the value of the state. The
algorithm exits when power balance is satisfied for the system
(i.e., the norm of the mismatch is less than the tolerance; see
line 30).
Consider an attack scenario where the attacker is targeting
a single bus. In this case, all buses should be made V buses
except the target bus. The attack is now described in context
of a Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) 9-bus
test system [22]. In this example, the scenario is that the
attacker modifies the data such that the system appears to be
experiencing an overload. In reality, the system is fine, but the
attacker is trying to entice us to shed load.
The system has the true data values shown in Table II. The
attacker chooses false-data injection values for modification.
In this example, the attacker's goal is to spoof the data to
make it look like Q6 increased by 100 MVAr. When this
is accomplished via Algorithm 1, we (the operators) see the
numbers in Table III.
The summary of the attack scenario is this. By manipulating
the measurements at bus 6, the attacker is able to (1) cause
the voltage at bus 6 to appear high (1.07 per unit instead
of 1.01) thereby causing us to consider taking some control
actions, like shedding load, and (2) the attacker's changes are
consistent with the power flow solution, so it will be undetected
using conventional residual-based bad data detection
[23]. Note that the attacker also necessarily modifies a couple
of measurements at bus 4 and bus 9; these are the boundary

buses to bus 6. This attack scenario is demonstrated by the
authors in the video [19].
What this effect, of needing to manipulate the boundary bus
values, represents is that the attacker must be able to defeat the
defender's attempt to protect basic measurements. As proven
in [14] and shown in various ways throughout the recent
literature on defenses against false data injection, as long as
a defender is able to protect a set of basic measurements,
that is, those that are needed for observability of the system,
unobservable attacks such as those presented here are not
possible. Hence, as an attacker, the goal would be to violate
this protection mechanism. This is a fundamental principle
related to power system observability and the physical characteristics
of the system: any attack which is truly unobservable
(stealthy) must cause the defender to violate the assumption of
protected basic measurements. A state is observable if there is
a measurement equation which provides enough information to
estimate the state. Hence, if all measurements which reflect the
value of the state variable are compromised, then the attacker
has complete control over that state.
D. Attacker Knowledge and Discussion
The strategy presented creates unobservable attacks on the
AC power flow equations and presents a specific way of
implementing these attacks. The inputs to Algorithm 1 are
the adversary's knowledge of the system topology Ybus, the
system state s ;V, and the power injections P0, Q0. The
attacker is free to make assumptions about these values. Here,
we examine the minimum knowledge required by an attacker
to perform the attack.
Let us denote as target buses the buses where we focus our
P and Q injection changes (i.e., bus 6 in our example). Let
us denote as boundary buses all buses adjacent to the target
buses (i.e., buses 4 and 9). All non-boundary and non-target
buses are assumed to be unmodifiable.
Fixed V buses have no entries in the power flow Jacobian,
and all buses are fixed V except the target buses. The only
equations which must be solved are the P and Q equations at
the target buses. The solution gives the state variables V and
at the target buses. Then, by inspection of the power flow
equations, the only buses whose P and Q equations depend
on V and at the target buses are the boundary buses. For
this reason, it is necessary that the attacker be able to modify
the power injection values at the boundary buses.
In summary, the only measurements needed when calculating
an unobservable attack are measurements at the buses

adjacent to the target buses. Therefore, in order to perform
an unobservable attack, the adversary does not need to know
everything about the system, but only needs to know local
information (both measurements and topology) only one layer
out from the target buses.
IV. PROBING DEFENSE
The probing defense described in this paper uses an observe
and perturb methodology to compare the expected results of
a control action with the observed response of the system.
The method uses only observed data values, and the expected
results of the control actions can be determined using historical
data, if available. The goal is to utilize our perceived but
incorrect measurement state of the system to discern the spoof.
The approach in [9] is to change settings on Distributed
Flexible AC Transmission System (D-FACTS) devices [24],
[25] to cause impact on measurements, but any available
control devices may be used (tap changing transformers, generators,
switched shunts, etc.). We can obtain predictions of the
impact of the probe on our measurements. The fundamental
idea is that if the measurements do not change in the way we
expect, there may be cause for alarm, and further investigation
is warranted. The vector of settings for each device is termed
345
A. Assumptions
The adversary is assumed to be modifying measurement
values, but no assumptions are made about how this is done.
We do not consider whether the attack occurs through a
compromise of the data channel, the device, the control center,
etc. The control devices are assumed to already be in place in
the system for another purpose (e.g., loss minimization). The
defenders are assumed to have control over the devices. We
consider that the attack vector may be different at each time.
The keys are pre-determined values, required to produce measurement
changes that are large enough to be distinguishable
from system noise.
We assume for simplicity that there are no other measurable
events while conducting the series of probes, e.g., load and
generation remain reasonably constant. Accounting for load
or generation changes or other events while conducting a
sequence is outside the scope of the current work, but is a
future research direction.
B. Observations of Measurement States
In discussing the defense, a different definition of 'state'
is needed from the power flow state described in Section III.
We denote the measurement state of the system under key
ki as mi, which is a vector of measurements corresponding
to a single snapshot of the system which includes a specific
power flow state and topology. This can be a vector of real
and reactive line flows. In the rest of the discussion, the
measurement state is referred to only as the state.
Let the true initial state of the system be m0. The observed
initial state of the system, m~0, may not be the same as the
true initial state, since an attack may or may not be present.
From m0, the first probe is enacted, causing the system to
achieve its new true state
m1 = d1(m0)
where d1 is the updated solution to the nonlinear power flow
equations ((2), (3)) based on the application of key k1. In
this work, we use di to model the behavior of the true (and
possibly unobservable) physical system under perturbation.
This true state m1 is unknown to us. The state we observe
after applying the probe is given by:
(10)
(11)
(12)
(13)
(14)
a key. This key is chosen from a set of acceptable keys. Keys,
keyspaces, and key choice are explored further in [9].
Elements in the vector where the attacker does not have control
are indicated by subscript j:
(8)
(9)
346
aij = 0 8 j 2= M
Our problem is to determine M (which set of meters
the attacker is controlling), and to a lesser extent, the attack
injections (a0, a1) (what was the attacker doing).
At each time snapshot, the system has a measurement state
mi. The measurement state resulting from subsequent probe
kj is mj. The corresponding observed states are m~i and m~j.
This results in the following set of equalities:
mj
m~j
=
=
dj(mi); 8 j
dj(mi) + aj =
mj + aj; 8 j
We expect that dj(m0) = dj(mi) 8 i; j, which relies on
the assumption that the underlying state of the system is not
changing. That is, we are not experiencing changes in load or
generation, or topology other than our perturbations.
C. Attack Detection
If a probing sequence is enacted such that the system is
made to return to a previously observed state, the difference
between the expected result of the probe and the actual
perceived effect of the probe will reveal the existence of bad
data and its locations.
To see how this is possible, consider the system, its true
values, and its perceived values at each time instant or probing
snapshot. The examples for the first probe are given above (9),
and the equations for each additional probe can be written in
a similar way.
Now, consider the possibility that the attack vector is not
solely dependent on the state, but could vary across different
visits to a particular state. That is, the attack vectors for an
observed state m~i may be different when that state is observed
at different times. This means that the attacker's injections may
change from ai to ai , where denotes one transition to state
mi and denotes a subsequent transition. Then, let the actual
perceived measurement state at transition be m~ i; , and let
the expected measurement state due to a previous transition
be m~ i; . The difference can be written as follows,
m~1
=
=
d1(m0) + a1
m1 + a1
where a1 denotes the attacker's spoof applied to the system
while in state m1. Note that if an attack is present, the actual where mi is a state which has previously been visited. Here,
observed state after applying the probe is different from the we take advantage of the fact that we are probing the system
expected state calculated with the probe. to states we have been to before. The observed quantity (14)

D. Discussion
We note a few observations from these results. First, based
only on our observed quantities, after actuating a careful
sequence of probes and observing the responses, it may be
possible to isolate the source of the false data injection attack.
A fundamental caveat is obvious from examination of equation
(14). In this formulation, if ai; and ai; are equal, the attack
remains undetectable. This result seems to indicate that if it is
possible for an attacker to always maintain a specific attack for
a given state, this defense will not work. In that case, there is
really no incentive for an attacker to change his or her attack
vector unless unless it is necessary in order to launch stealthy
attacks. However, it may still be possible for the defenders
to unmask those attacks. For example, rather than using ai;
(a single observation) as our expected value, we can use a
weighted average over many previous observations. Multiple
targeted probing sequences can be initiated to obtain more sets
of data.
One important point is that the probes do not need to
be from D-FACTS devices. Nowhere in this analysis is the
presence of D-FACTS included or shown to be necessary. Any
probing mechanism which is capable of producing observable
changes in the system can be used as part of the probing defense
strategy. The need for measurable perturbations resulting
from a probe is examined in [9]. Finally, if an attack is not
stealthy, this defense strategy may not be needed at all, as the
attack could readily be detected by other more conventional
means.
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have shown how to launch unobservable
attacks against the AC power flow equations using only
local information. We have also proposed a particular probing
defense strategy to detect attacks by enacting sequences of
probes and keeping track of the observed quantities. The
defense is independent of the type of probe as well as the
type of attack. Future work will explore the effectiveness of
the attacks and the probing defense, as the adversary's view
of the system is varied.
