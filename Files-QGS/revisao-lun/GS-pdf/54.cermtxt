Hybrid Robust Controller Design: Cyber Attack Attenuation for
Cyber-Pbysical Systems
Cheolhyeon Kwon and Inseok Hwang
Abstract-This paper considers controller design for CyberPhysical
Systems (CPSs) that are robust to various types of
cyber attacks. While the previous studies have investigated a
secure control by assuming a specific attack strategy, in this
paper we propose a hybrid robust control scheme that contains
multiple sub-controllers, each matched to a specific type of cyber
attacks. Then the system can be adapted to various cyber attacks
(including those that are not assumed for sub-controller design)
by switching its sub-controllers to achieve the best performance.
We propose a method for designing the secure switching logic
to counter all possible cyber attacks and mathematically verify
the system's performance and stability as well. The performance
of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by an example
with the hybrid H2 - Ho controller applied to an Unmanned
Aerial System (UAS).
I. INTRODUCTION
The security issues for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs)
against cyber attacks have emerged as an important yet challenging
problem due to their close integration of the physical
processes, computational resources, and communication
capabilities [1]. Despite the advances in information security,
such as the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data,
these methods alone are not sufcfiient for CPSs to deal with
various cyber attacks. In order to complement the security of
the CPS from the system's perspective, secure control theory
which studies how cyber attacks afect the physical dynamics
of the system has been exploited in the last few years [2].
Within the secure control framework, our earlier work
[3], [4] was focused on analyzing the system's response
during cyber attacks and its vulnerabilities using information
about the dynamical model of the CPS. In this paper we
extend our research along this direction to develop a control
scheme that alleviates the effect of cyber attacks. Most of
the previous research on secure controller design is based
on the game theoretical approach and/or the classical optimal
control paradigms. In the game theoretical approach, the cyber
attacker(s) and the protector(s) are players competing for goals
in a dynamic game[5]. This has been applied to controls
over a compromised network [6], electric power systems [7],
etc. In the optimal control paradigms, on the other hand,
diefrent control methods such as the maximum principle [8],
H2 and Ho control [9], etc, have been proposed to optimize
the system's performance under a specicfi attack model. For
instance, [10] provides a secure control scheme in the presence
of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

In all the works mentioned above, the secure control problems
are subject to anticipated attack strategies, where the
attack is assumed to be known a priori and can thus be treated
as a parameter in the problem. However, since the attacker's
intent is independent of the controller's actions and may even
change during the cyber attack, the designed secure controls,
although optimal under a certain attack assumption, may not
be so in the case of unforeseen and arbitrary attacks. This
means that their performances could degrade if the actual
attack deviates from one assumed by a controller. Our work
therefore studies the design of a secure control scheme with
the ability of adapting the system with respect to various cyber
attacks. Inspired by a hybrid system model, we propose a hybrid
robust controller that consists of multiple sub-controllers,
each designed to counter a specicfi type of cyber attacks, and
can switch among them to optimize its performance against
various types of cyber attacks, including those that are not
assumed for sub-controller design. The main objective of this
paper is to design the switching logic which enables the hybrid
controller to switch to the most secure sub-controller.
For this task, we adopt the linear-quadratic performance
criteria to evaluate the system and control performance. Using
this criteria, it can be said that a certain controller is more
secure than another if its evaluated performance is better
than another under a given cyber attack. In other words, the
most secure sub-controller at each time step is the one whose
future performance is the best under expected future cyber
attacks. Since the future attack behavior is unpredictable, we
instead compute the worst-performanceof each sub-controller.
Once the system compares these worst-performances, the most
secure sub-controller is determined and the switching to this
sub-controller occurs accordingly. Such a switching logic is
proved that the hybrid controller performs better than a single
sub-controller and maintains its stability as well. Here, the
estimated worst-performance depends on the system's current
state and past attack history. Hence, unlike previous research,
our hybrid control scheme incorporates the past attack information
into the design of secure controls.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section
II, we describe a CPS dynamics subject to cyber attacks
and present a hybrid robust control afrmework. Section III
presents a hybrid control scheme with the switching logic.
More precisely, we present a cyber attack history construction
method and an algorithm for the secure switching logic which
can make the hybrid controller switch to the sub-controller that
has the best performance under the current cyber attack. The
performance of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated

in Section IV, where the controller is exempliefid by the hybrid
H2 - Ho controller. Conclusions are given in Section V.
II. PROBLEM FORMULA TION
We consider in this paper the discrete-time linear CPS
model subject to a set of priori-unknown cyber attacks:
xa(k + 1) = AXa(k) + Bu(k) + Bea(k),
z(k) = CXa(k) + DU(k)
Xa(O) = Xo
(1)
where xa(k) E IRn (the subscript 'a' means the system with
cyber attacks), u(k) E IRP, z(k) E IRm are the system's
state, input, and performance output respectively. A, B, C
and D are the system matrices of appropriate dimensions, and
kEN denotes the discrete-time index, taking values from the
time horizon (possibly innfiite) N = {O, 1, 2, . , N}. Then
various cyber attacks a(k)E IRs are injected into the system
with the attack matrix Be of compatible dimension.
Assumption 1. It is assumed that Be is of full column rank and
the matrix pairs (A, B) and (A, Be) satisfy the controllability
condition.
Under this assumption, we can consider the worst security
problem because the attackers with partial control access to
the system could only cause less trouble than those with full
control access. For simplicity, let us use the following notation
throughout the paper:
X[Tl,T2] := [XT(Tl) X T(TI + 1) . . . XT(T2)]T
Regarding the performance output z(k), we assume that:
(i)rank(D)= p
(iiD)TC = 0
With the above assumptions, the quadratic performance criteria
associated with the system under cyber attacks is given by:
J(Uh,T2] ' ah,T2] ) := IZIh,T2] 112 + Xr(T2 + I)CTCxa(T2 + 1)
where]( is a state feedback gain matrix. When the system (1)
has such a controller, its closed-loop behavior is governed by:
xa(k + 1) = (A + B]( (k)) xa(k) + Bea(k)
Then, the cyber attack attenuation problem is to design a
feedback gain history ](* (k) which minimizes J over all
energy bounded attacks:

(5)
Since the attack sequence a(k) is unknown a priori, an attack
scenario is assumed in order to solve the above optimization
problem . Therefore, the solution is optimal only if the attacker
behaves as assumed by the controller. In order to improve
the performance of the controller under various cyber attacks,
we employ a hybrid controller K that consists of multiple
controllers, which are given by:
(] (k)E K = {]( ;I qE {1, 2, '" ,r }, kEN }
(6)
where]( ; denotes a controller designed for a particular attack
strategy. Figure 1 illustrates a schematic of the proposed hybrid
controller design. Note that the actual cyber attack may differ

where Q = CTC : 0 and R = DTD >- O.
Assumption 2. The attack sequence a(k) is assumed to be
signals with bounded energy, i.e., Ila[o,N] II< p2 where p is a
measurable constant.
Assumption 2 is motivated by the practical consideration
that, due to the physical limitation of control units in a CPS,
e.g., power capacity, operation range, etc., attacker cannot
inject arbitrarily large attack sequences. Without loss of generality,
we consider the control sequence as closed-loop controls
such as u(k) = p, (Xa[O,k] ), where p, is a mapping function,
commonly called the control law or sttraegy. If permissible
controllers are linear, one can represent the function f via a
linear state feedback formulation such that:
u(k) = ]( (k)xa(k)

logic which makes the hybrid controller perform safer than the

III. HYBRID ROBUST CONTROLLER DESIGN
This section presents a robust control scheme against various
cyber attacks, called discrete-time linear Robust Hybrid
Control System, which is a collection of the following vfie
tuples 1-l = (Q, Xa, A, f, G):
Q = {I, 2, . . . ,r } is a finite set of the discrete state
variables.
Xa = IRn is the continuous state space.
A = [0, p2] is the attack energy space.
f : Q x Xa -+ Xa is a function that describes the evolution
of the continuous state. With (6), f is denfied as:
f(q, x) := (A + B]( ;)x
Consequently, ofrm
(4), the continuous state dynamics is

Therefore, each guard G(i, j , k) describes a partition of the
space Xa x A into a number of closed cells and its induced

the restriction on the energy of the future attack sequences
a[k,N]' we further denfie two functions J: Q x Xa x Ax N -7

optimization problems:

(10)
single-valued at all time, and thus every execution of 1-l is
well-denfied under any possible attack sequences.
The perfomance of the hybrid control system 1-l
characterized
by the guard condition (10) is ensured through the
following theorem.
Theorem l. Optimality Condition Let hi

([ o,N], a[O,N]) := J (U[O,N], a[O,N])
(11)
((k).
where u*(k) = K;(k)Xa(k) is determined by the hybrid state
Then, for the cyber attacks with the bounded energy p,
the following inequality holds:
a[G,N[
max J }{ (([O ,N], a[O,N]):;
min
{qEQ} a[D,N[
max J (u[qO,N], a[O,N]) (12)
Proof
The theorem is proved by induction. Using (9), the
right-hand side of (12) can be rewritten as:
min
{qEQ} a[D,N[
maxJ (u[O,N]' a[O,N])
= argmin { J(q,xa( O), O,O )lqE Q}
Under an arbitrary admissible attack sequence, the initial discrete
state q(O ) is generated according to the guard condition
(10) such that:
J }{ (([O ,O], a[O,O]) + J(q( O), xa(l), Il[ao,o] 121,1)
;: J(q(
O),x a(O), 0, 0) = argmin { J(q,x a(O), 0, 0)I qE Q}
And every discrete state transition at each k = 1, 2, .
satisefis the following inequaility:
J }{ (([O ,k], a[O,k]) + J(q(k), xa(k + 1), Il[ao,k]121,k + 1)
;: J }{ (([O ,k-I], a[O,k-I]) + J(q(k - l ),x a(k), Il[ao,k-I]112, k)
For the final discrete state q(N), the following inequality can
be induced by the guard condition:
J }{ (([O ,N],a[O,N])
J }{ (([O ,N-I],a[O,N-I)]
+ J (q(N - 1),x a(N), Il[ao,N-I]I2I,N)
Arranging the inequlities (14), (15), and (16) in the order of
the maginitude, one can obtain (12).
Remark l. Here the cost J (u[O,N]' a[O,N]) implies the performance
of the system adopting the ih controller only. Thus, if
-1l
is subject to the worst-case attack, Theorem 1 guarantees
the performance of the hybrid controller is equivalent to or
better than any individual sub-controller. Now we will show
that the switching logic governed by the guard condition (10)
guarantees the stability of the hybrid controller.
Theorem 2. Stability Condition Suppose the multiple feedback
controllers individually satisfy the asymptotic stability condition,
i.e.,

Note that VHmay not be monotonically decreasing along the
consecutive switchings. Using (18), the cost function can be
written as the sum of the Lyapunov-like functions:

Likewise, from
(11), we know that:

(21)
With the energy bounded attack sequence along the infinite
time horizon N = [0,(0) , the stability condition (17) yields:
On the other hand, substituting (20) and (21) for (12) gives:

Then the hybrid control system 1-l
(17) is also asymptotically stable.

Proof Consider a collection of quadratic Lyapunov-Iike functions
denfied as:
They correspond to each discrete state q and are concatenated
together to produce a time-varying Lyapunov function for 1-l
such that:
From (22), 2:%0 V(qxa(k)) is bounded regardless of the
attack sequence. Hence, %2: 0 VH(xa(k), k) is also bounded,
that leads to:
By the Lyapunov theorem, the existence of the positive definite
Lyapunov function VHsatisfying (24) guarantees the asymptotic
stability of 1-l. •
Now, we leverage analytical tools for the switching logic for
two reasons: Firstly, as shown in (8), the discrete state transition
function I requires the expanded information structure
where the system is allowed to observe the past attack history
a[O,k-lj. This is in general an advantage to the controller,
which requires an attack reconstruction procedure. Secondly,
the guard condition G depends upon functions J and ,J.
both of which are based on the computationally intensive
optimization problem (9). Thus, considering a number of guard
sets over the whole time horizon N, the overall computation
cost could become numerically unmanageable. However, for
the deterministic linear model considered in this paper, we are
able to develop analytical and computationally efficient cyber
attack reconstruction and switching algorithms.
(20)

(24)
Attack ReconstructionFrom the continuous state dynamics
(7), the previous attack vector at time k - 1 can be
reconstructed as:
a(k - 1) =B -: (Xa(k) - (A + BK;(k)) Xa(k - 1) )
(25)
where B-: = (B'1 Be)- lB'1 denotes the Moore-Penrose
pseudo inverse of matrix Be. Since Il[a0,k-ljI12
Il[a0,k- jI12+Ila(k-1)112, the amount of the past attack energy
2
can be recursively updated through the hybrid state evolution
((k).
Analytical Function Evaluation As a solution to (4), the
state evolution to the attack sequence is given by the following
convolution sums:
k-l
xa(k) = f( O, k)x a(O) + L f( T,k - l) Bea(T)
T=O
where f : N x N -+ jRnxn is the matrix function denfied as:
{ :fi
qn, , ) .
(A+ BK(T))
For the system controlled by the single feedback gain K; , the
matrix function f q is:
fq (Tl,T2):= (A+ BK;r2 -Tl,
Tl:S;T 2
To analytically evaluate the upper and lower bounds of the cost
function, we denfie the following attack correlation matrix:
PIq (i,j ) := 1
min(ij,)
L fJ (T, i)(Q + K;T RK;) rq(T,j )
T=l
+ f J (O,i ) Q fq (O,j )
fJ (O,i ) Q fq (O,j )
ifVi,j >O
if min(i, j )=0
for each discrete state q. Plugging (26) and (28) to (2), the
future cost during a time interval [k, N] can be transformed
into the following quadratic form:
J (u[k,Nj, a[k,Nj)= x (k) IPq (N - k,N - k)x a(k)
+ 2a ,Njnq(k,N)x a(k) + a ,NjWq(k, N)a [k,Nj
(29)
where nq(k,N) and Wq(k,N) are the block matrices respectively

From (29), we introduce a Lagrange multiplier f-L

define the Lagrange function for the optimization problem (9)

Now, let us consider a combinatorial attack strategy that
contains both the worst-case attack and the random attack.
Here, the attacker injects the worst-caseattack sequence first
and then changes his attack strategy to the random attack
sequence at k = 10. As shown in Figures 5 and 6, while each
sub-controllerperforms poorly when it is subject to a different
type of cyber attack from the one assumed for its design,
the hybrid controller compensates for the attack effect by
switching its sub-controllerfrom
Ho
to H2 optimal controller.
Note that there is some switching delay due to the delay for
the attack change detection. To further improve the system's
performance, we need to investigate this aspect in the future
research.

attacks.
In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid robust control
scheme which has a capability of adapting its control law
with respect to various cyber attacks. The proposed hybrid
controller consists of a set of multiple sub-controllers, each
designed for a assumed cyber attack and it can switch
among the sub-controllers. The system's robustness then can
be improved by switching to the most secure sub-controller
according to the reconstructed past attack sequence as well
as the system's current state. In addition, we have derived
an analytic algorithm to compute the guard conditions that
governs the switching of the hybrid controller. To illustrate
the proposed idea, we have considered a special class of the
hybrid controller in which H2 and Ho
optimal controllers
are designed as the sub-controllers.Simulation results with an
Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) example demonstrate that the
hybrid H2 - Ho
controller performs better than either single
optimal controller against various types of cyber
