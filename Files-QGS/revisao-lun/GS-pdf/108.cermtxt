Abstract-A novel class of malicious data attacks, LPAttack,
are presented against the state estimation process in Smart Grid.
Here LP represents leverage points, which are the outliers in the
factor space of the regression model for Smart Grid state estimation.
The attacker strategically manipulates the parameter data in
Smart Grid to mislead the control center with incorrect system
parameter information, such that leverage points are created
within the factor space of the state estimation regression model.
As a result, the attacker can freely inject arbitrary errors into the
meter measurements corresponded with the leverage points, while
bypassing the existing bad data detection mechanism. We first
introduce the fundamental principles and strategies of launching
LPAttack in Smart Grid. Then the potential countermeasure
based on robust Schweppe-Huber Generalized-M estimator is
proposed. Finally, we evaluate the LPAttack principles and its
countermeasure through simulations in IEEE test system, and
examine in particular the effect of the attacks on Locational
Marginal Prices in real-time pricing power market.
I. INTRODUCTION
Smart Grid is envisioned to improve the efficiency of
the legacy power system by integrating cyber infrastructure
for sensing, control, computation and communication. State
estimation is a key system monitoring process deployed in
power control center to estimate the unknown state variables
based on meter measurement data, power network topology
data and parameter data [1]. The output of state estimation
lays the foundation for a series of subsequent critical control
processes, such as contingency analysis, security constrained
power analysis, and real-time pricing in power market, etc.
Due to the strong dependency on the cyber infrastructure
for data collection, transmission and storage in Smart Grid, it
becomes more likely for malicious attackers to compromise
meters, intercept data, or even gain access to the databases to
mislead the state estimation process with tampered data, which
could lead to serious unstable power operating conditions or
even blackout. Therefore, the data security of state estimation
for Smart Grid is a key concern with increasing urgency for
cyber security research.
Quite a few of existing works have already addressed the
issue. In [2], Liu et al. are firstly introduced the concept
of false data attacks against Smart Grid state estimation.
Assuming the attackers keep the original network topology

Research Laboratory at Georgia State University.
data and parameter data intact, the authors shows that the
attacker can inject errors to the meter measurement data in
certain ways while without being detected by the existing bad
data detectors. Inspired by the work in [2], extensive further
developments are made in [3] [4] [5] [6], etc. Different undetectable
attacks and defence strategies are presented. However,
all the above works only consider the manipulations of meter
measurement data, and the errors introduced by the attacker
to the meter measurements have to be in the column space of
the Jacobian matrix of the state estimation regression model.
In [7], the authors at first introduce another kind of malicious
data attack, called topology attack. The key innovation is that
the manipulations of power network topology data are also
considered.
In this paper, we present a novel class of malicious data
attack against Smart Grid state estimation, called LPAttack.
Here LP represents leverage points, which are the outliers
in the factor space of the regression model for state estimation
[8]. Different from the previous works, we present a
brand new approach to launching undetectable data attacks
by strategically manipulating the parameter data, such that
leverage points are created within the factor space of the state
estimation regression model. The key feature about leverage
point is that the residual of the measurement corresponded
with the leverage point will be very small even when it
is contaminated with a very large error [8]. Based on this
key feature, the attacker can freely introduce arbitrary errors
into the meter measurements while without being detected by
the existing bad data detection mechanisms. The concept of
leverage point is not new in power system state estimation,
however, as far as we know, we are the first to explore the
potentials of cyber attacks employing this feature. The key
contributions in the paper are:
We present and rigorously prove the validity of the fundamental
principles and strategies for launching LPAttacks.
We propose a potential countermeasure against the attacks
based on robust Schweppe-Huber Generalized-M
estimator.
We evaluate the attacking principles and countermeasure
in IEEE test system, and examine in particular the effects
of attacks on the real time pricing in power market.

II. PRELIMINARIES
State estimation: Figure 1 demonstrates the typical state
estimation process in control center. State estimation takes
three kinds of data as input:
z: The meter measurement data, including power injections
at buses and power flows across branches.
t: The network topology data, indicating the on/off status
of power network switches between buses.
p: The parameter data, typically including: 1) the branch
susceptance data and 2) the variances of meter measurement
errors, etc.
Typically, z, t and p are either sent wirely/wirelessly from
meters to control center, or kept in databases.
After taking the input, the topology processing and observability
analysis process would generate the regression model
equation, in which:
1) The matrix H depends on the topology data t and the
branch susceptance data in p;
2) The variances of each meter measurement error ei in
vector e, denoted by i2, are part of data in p.
Then the weighted least-square state estimator is used to get
the best estimates of the unknown state variables x, which are
the voltage magnitude and phase angle at each bus.

Mathematically, a precise definition of state estimation is
given as follows [1]. Let x = (x1; x2; :::; xn)T and z =
(z1; z2; :::; zm)T denote state variables and meter measurements,
respectively, where n is the number of unknown state
variables, m is the number of meter measurements, and m
n. Further let e = (e1; e2; :::; em)T denote meter measurement
errors, which are assumed to be normally distributed with zero
mean. The state variables are related to the measurements by:
z = h(x) + e
where h(x) = (h1(x1; x2; :::; xn); :::; hm(x1; x2; :::; xn))T ,
and E(e) = 0 and cov(e) = W , and W is defined as:

The state estimation problem is formulated as the following
Weighted Least Square (WLS) format:
minimize 1 rT W r
x 2
subject to z = h(x) + r
For state estimation in standard DC power flow [1], the
Equation (1) can be represented by a linear regression model:
z = Hx + e
where H is an m n full rank Jacobian matrix of the
measurement model. Then the WLS state estimator will give
the following solution:
x^ = (HT W H) 1HT W z
Bad data detection: Measurement residuals are employed by
the bad data detection techniques in Smart Grid to protect
state estimation process against abnormality in measurement
data, which are usually caused by nature or faulty sensors. The
measurement residual is represented as:
r = z
z^ = z
Hx^
The objective function for bad data detection is defined as:
where Hi is the ith row of H. Then in the J (x^) test:
J (x^) =
m
X (zi
i=1
Hix^)2

= Xm ri22
i=1 i
J (x^) =
( Bad data ;
if J (x^) > "
Good data ; if J (x^)
"
where " is an empirical detection threshold defined in control
center. If no bad data is detected, the state estimation resulted
x^ would be accepted by the subsequent control processes.
Otherwise, an alarm is fired and new data must be incorporated
to start over the whole process.
III. LPATTACK:LEVERAGE POINT ATTACK
We assume that the attackers can access and manipulate the
data z, t, and p as needed to launch the attacks.
Let z = W 12 z, r = W 21 r, H = W 21 H and e = W 21 e,
from (4):
z = H
x + e
where E[e] = 0 and cov[e] = Im. Then the WLS solution for
x in (5) can be rewritten as:
and the residual,
x^ = (HT H) 1HT z
r = z
Hx^ = (Im
K)z
where Im is the m dimensional identity matrix and K is
defined as:
K = H(HT H) 1HT

It follows from the above equation that 0

A. Principles of LPAttack
In the above regression model, the row vector Hi =
(Hi1; Hi2; :::; Hin) defines a factor point in the n dimensional
factor space of the regression. The outliers which are far
away from the bulk of the factor points in this space are
called leverage points and the corresponding measurements
are called leverage measurements [8]. Geometrically, Kii
gives a measure of the distance from the factor point Hi to
the bulk of the remaining (m 1) factor points. Therefore, a
larger Kii would simply indicate a leverage point.
A large value of Kii will also imply that there is a strong
influence of the ith measurement zi on its estimated z^i,
such that the estimated value is essentially determined by
its measured value [1]. Thus we call the value of Kii as
the leverage of measurement zi. As we can see from (10)
and (12), as Kii becomes closer to 1, the residual ri would
be very small, no matter how much error is introduced into
measurement zi. Since the bad data detection process depends
solely on the measurement residual, it would fail to reject
the measurement data even when it is contaminated with a
very large error. In other words, the larger the attackers can
increase the value of Kii, the less likely the perturbation of
measurement zi can be detected by the bad data detection
process. This is the key idea of LPAttack. Theorem 1 gives
the general relationship between any set of measurements z
and the values of Kii when it can pass the J (x^) test.
Theorem 1: Let " be the threshold and i=1;:::;m be the
variances of errors in the J (x^) test. Given any set of measurements
z, it is guaranteed to pass the J (x^) test when
Pim=1(1 Kii) Pjm=1(zj2= j2) ".

(19)
The measurement z is guaranteed to pass the J (x^) test.
Theorem 1 suggests a loosely bound condition for the
attacker to launch a successful attack in general. From a
pragmatic point of view, it is more worth investigating how the
perturbation of a particular measurement zi, can be marked by
the only change of Kii.
Theorem 2: Suppose the original set of measurements z
can bypass the J (x^) test. When the measurement zi in z is
perturbed into zi0 by the attacker, there always exists a new
value Ki0i 2 (Kii; 1], such that the new measurement set z0 is
guaranteed to bypass the J (x^) test.
Proof: Since the original measurements z can bypass the
J (x^) test, from (10), we have:
J (x^) = rT r = zT (Im
K)T (Im
K)z
"
Since matrix Im
K is idempotent, from the above we have:
zT (Im
K)z
"
Let = " zT (Im K)z, z0 = W 12 z0, 4z = z0
order for z0 to pass the test, it must also satisfy:
(zT + 4zT )(Im
K)(z + 4z)
"
Expand (18) and compare with (17), we have:
4zT (Im
K)(z0 + z)
Note 4z only has one nonzero element 4zi since only the
ith measurement is perturbed. So, the above is equivalent to:
m
4zi[( X
j=1;j6=i
Kij cj ) + ci(1
Kii)]
;
(20)
where cj = zj0 + zj , for j = 1; 2; :::; m. Combined with (12),
it can be seen that for any value of 4zi, equation (20) is
guaranteed to be satisfied when increasing the value Kii to a
particular value Ki0i 2 (Kii; 1]. In particular, when Ki0i = 1,
4zi can be infinity.
Theorem 2 demonstrates how much the attacker has to
increase the value Kii after the perturbation of a single
measurement zi. Note that in cases when the attacker wants
to perturb multiple measurements, he would perturb the measurement
one at a time and Theorem 2 is applied repeatedly
to each targeted measurement with the most updated Kii and
z. One last question for the attacker would be how to actually
increase the value of Kii. The following theorem gives the
answer.

B. LPAttack strategies in Smart Grid
In this part, we introduce the specific attacking strategies in
Smart Grid by applying the above principles.
1) Attacking power flow measurement
Power flow measurement is the one placed between buses
to monitor the power flow across the connecting branch. If an
entry zi of z is the measurement of the power flow from bus
k to m, then zi = Bkm(xk xm), where Bkm is the branch
susceptance between bus k and m and xk; xm are the unknown
voltage phase angles at bus k and m. The corresponding ith
row of H is:
kth entry mth entry
Hi = [0; :::; | B{kzm }; 0; :::; 0; | B{zkm }; :::; 0]
(25)
If the attacker intends to alter the measurement from zi to zi0
without being detected, he should apply Theorem 2 first to
figure out how much he has to increase the value of Kii, then
applies rule 1 and rule 2, which requires increasing the value
of Bkm and decreasing the value of i.
2) Attacking power injection measurement
Power injection measurement is placed at bus to monitor the
power injection of the particular bus, typically from a load or
synchronized generator. If zi is the measurement of power
injection at bus i, it is the sum of all the power flows along
incident branches to that bus: zi = Pj2Ni zij , where Ni is
the set of buses incident to i, e.g. , k; m 2 Ni. Therefore, the
corresponding ith row of H is the sum of all the row vectors
corresponding to the incident branch power flows, which is:
Hi = [0; :::;
ith entry
|X{z }
Bij ; :::;
j2Ni
kth entry
| {z }
Bik ; :::;
mth entry
| B{zim }; :::; 0]
(26)
If the attacker intends to alter the measurement from zi to z0
i
without being detected, he applies Theorem 2 first to figure
out how much he has to increase the value of Kii, then he
can apply rule 1 and rule 2 in this case. In addition, since
the number of nonzero elements is related to the physical
connections of buses in power network, rule 3 cannot be
applied directly. However, it is still valuable since it suggests
that the power injection measurements at buses with more
incident branches are more vulnerable since they already have
a large leverage in normal condition.
C. Remarks
Several facts are worth pointing out from the above analysis.
First, since i is the standard deviation of measurement error
ei, a smaller i indicates a higher accuracy of the measurement
zi. This implies that high accuracy measurement is more likely
to become a leverage point and attacking a higher accuracy
device will actually have better chance of success. Second,
increasing the susceptance of branches should be the first
choice of the attacker since it can affect the branch flow measurement
and the power injection measurements at incident

Note that since y^ = Kei, then with (22), we get Hit^ = Kii.
Also set t = HiT =k HiT k22, then (1 Hit)2 = 0. From (24),
(1
Kii)2
k Hpt k22 + k Hf t k22
k Hpt^ k22
From Theorem 3, it can be seen that the attacker can increase
the value of Kii by just increasing the l2-norm of HiT . Since
Hi = 1= i Hi, then mathematically it gives three rules to
increase the value of Kii:
Rule 1: Increase the absolute values of elements in Hi.
Rule 2: Decrease the value of i.
Rule 3: Increase the number of non-zero elements in Hi.

buses simultaneously. Third, the existences of leverage points
in actual power system are very common. For instance, the
IEEE 118-bus system has 7:2% of branches with relatively
large susceptance(13 over 179) and 28% of buses with at
least 4 incident branches (33 over 118) [8]. This suggests
that even without the explicit creations of leverage points, the
attacker can still launch LPAttack against the corresponding
measurements.
IV. COUNTERMEASURE
Since all the attacking strategies are based on the creation of
leverage points, the straightforward countermeasure would be
first evaluating the leverages of measurements to identify leverage
points, then discard corresponding measurements before
entering WLS state estimator. However, since the ubiquitous
existence of leverage points in power system and the leverage
measurements could be good when there is no cyber attacks,
the above approach would destroy a large amount of useful
information and could even make the system unobservable.
Therefore, a better solution should be replacing the WLS
with a more robust state estimator, which is designed to
automatically detect leverage points and suppress the influence
of corresponding measurements on the state estimation.
Inspired by the works in [9] [10], we present the countermeasure
based on the robust Schweppe-Huber Generalized-M
(SHGM) estimator. We modified SHGM such that it possesses
good robustness and efficiency against leverage-point attacks.
!i is specifically designed as the penalty factor to suppress the
effects of leverage measurements. The details are as follows:
minimize
x
i=1
subject to z = h(x) + r
m
(r) = X (ri)
where z; h(x) are the same as in (1), and (ri) is a function
of the measurement residual ri, which is defined as:
(ri) =
( 1 r2= i2
2 i
a !ijri= ij
21 a2 !i2
jri= ij a !i
otherwise
where a is a constant ranging from 1 to 3 and !i is defined
as:
!i = minf1; [
1
Kii
Kii
]g
(27)
Note that when a is infinity, the SHGM is equivalent to WLS.
We propose a solution algorithm based on numerically stable
iteratively re-weighted least squares method [11]. Writing
the KKT necessary conditions for a minimum of (r):

i=1
@ri = 0
@x
(ri)

ri Hi = 0
where (ri) = @@ri . Write the above in matrix form, we have:
HT
Q r = 0
where Q is a m dimensional diagonal matrix and Qii =
defined as:
Qii =
( 1

i
a !i sign(ri)
ri i
jri= ij a !i
otherwise
Also, from the first order Taylor approximation, we have:
h(x)
h(xk) + H
4xk
where k means the kth iteration. Since r = z h(x), rk = z
h(xk), combined with (28), we get the kth iteration equation:
HT
Q
H 4 xk = HT
Q rk
Note that matrix Q is keeping updated based on the residual
r of current iteration. Given an initial guess, equation (31)
would generate the final solution.
V. EVALUATION
We evaluate the proposed attacking strategy and countermeasure
using IEEE 14 test system in Figure 2. It is provided
with 12 power injection measurements and 13 power flow
measurements in normal steady state. In the following, IN i
denotes a power injection measurement at Bus i and FL i j
denotes a power flow measurement from Bus i to Bus j. We
extract configurations and parameters of the IEEE test systems
from MATPOWER.

The results from Table I imply some interesting facts. First,
we discover that in general, when the original magnitude of
measurement is large, the corresponding required 4Kii is
relatively large. This indicates that the attack against measurements
with smaller magnitude is easier to succeed. Second,
when the original value of Kii is large, such as IN4 and IN5,
the perturbations of corresponding measurements only require
small increase in Kii. This suggests that the attacks against
measurements with larger Kii are more prone to success.
Next we will study how the changes in parameters of branch
susceptance and measurement error variances will affect the
leverages of measurements. Figure 3 gives the result for IN5.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we present and rigorously prove the validity
of the principles and strategies of LPAttacks, the novel
data integrity attacks against state estimation in Smart Grid.
Countermeasure based on robust state estimation is proposed.
Our current attacking principles require the attacker to have a
global knowledge of the targeting Smart Grid system. Future
work would explore the possibility of conducting attacks only
using local information. Meanwhile, potential countermeasures
based on secure meter placement would also be studied.

Fig. 4. Residual in conventional WLS and our proposed countermeasure
Figure 4 shows the residuals after measurement perturbation
in both WLS and our countermeasure. We can see that the
residual in countermeasure is significantly larger than in WLS
and can fire the bad data detection alarm correspondingly in
most cases.
Finally, the effects of LPAttacks on power market, particularly
on the Locational Marginal Price (LMP), are examined.
LMP is the core variable in market operations and obtained
through the real-time pricing models. The real-time pricing
models are built on the power flow measurements given by
the state estimation process, thus our proposed leverage-point
attacks would directly affect the LMPs. We adopt the Ex-post
pricing model in [12] and conduct the sensitivity analysis of
LMP at each of the 14 buses with respect to perturbations in
different power flow measurements. Figure 5 shows the LMP
sensitivities of all 14 buses with respect to the changes in
three measurements: IN1, IN4 and FL5-6. The unit on vertical
axis is ($/MWh)/(puMVA). We can see that the perturbation
in measurements would have greater impact on the LMPs of
nearby buses than other buses. For example, perturbation of
