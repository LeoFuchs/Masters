Real-Time Intrusion Detection
in Power System Operations
Jorge Valenzuela, Jianhui Wang, Member, IEEE, and Nancy Bissinger, Student Member, IEEE
Abstract-Increasing power system security is crucial to the
future of the electric power grid. In this paper, we define a new
class of cyberattacks to power systems-malicious modification
of network data stored in an accessible database. Grounded in
multivariate statistical process control, our approach to intrusion
detection ensures data integrity in power system operations. We
develop an algorithm that monitors power flow results and detects
anomalies in the input values that could have been modified by
cyberattacks. Our algorithm uses principal component analysis
to separate power flow variability into regular and irregular
subspaces. Analysis of the information in the irregular subspace
determines whether the power system data has been compromised.
We verify the efficacy of the algorithm using both the IEEE 24-bus
and 118-bus reliability test systems. The results show that the
developed algorithm is a promising enhancement to data security
procedures in a control center.

[1].
Accountability Office (GAO) reported in 2009 that cyberthreats
to critical infrastructure like the power grid are increasing and
evolving. The sources of these threats-hackers, foreign nations,
disgruntled employees and terrorists-coupled with the
sophistication of technology and widespread documentation of
intrusion techniques on the Internet have led the government
to become increasingly concerned about the potential for cyberattack.
Fig. 1, from the United States Computer Emergency
Readiness Team (US CERT), illustrates that threats categorized
as unauthorized access and malicious code made up 32% of
cyberthreats to federal information systems and cyberbased
critical infrastructures in the three year timespan beginning
in 2006 [1]. Unauthorized access is considered logical (or
physical) access to data without permission. And, malicious
code is the successful installation of a virus, worm or other
code-based entity that infects a system and is not quarantined
by anti-virus software. The successful enactment of either of
these threats could disrupt operation of the power grid.
While the threat is real, cyberattacks have not disrupted
power delivery in the United States [2]. However, advanced
intruders can circumvent computer and network security. The
Stuxnet worm is one recent example of malicious code that
gained access to and damaged critical control systems in Iran's
nuclear program [3].
Our research defines a new class of cyberattacks to power systems-malicious
modification of network data stored in an accessible
database. We posit that data anomalies could be the result
of unauthorized access to and modification of data by an intruder
or by malicious code that is not quarantined by preventive
software. Since modern control centers use state-of-the-art security
to prevent cyberintrusion based on recommendations, regulations
and requirements from agencies like NERC, NIST and
DOE [4], operators expect the data stored in protected databases
to be secure. A cybercriminal could manage to get around security
measures and modify data in a database without the system
operator's knowledge.
The trustworthiness of the data passed among supervisory
control and data acquisition (SCADA), Energy Management
System (EMS) and Business Management System (BMS)
[5] program modules is extremely important for the proper
operation of the power grid. In addition, integrated topology
processing, such as in the PowerWorld software [6] provides
for information exchanges across operations and planning
modules. Output data from an operations module is often used
as input data to a planning module and vice versa. At any
point in the process of data collection and decision making,
data errors could lead to unnecessary and costly outages if not
recognized in a timely manner. The data could be compromised
not only through equipment or human errors but also by the
intervention of an intruder who tampers with the data stored
in a database or interferes with the module that processes real
time network topology.
The optimal power flow (OPF) program solves a set of nonlinear
equations using stored data to compute a steady state operation
point with the objective function varying according to the
target of the optimization. OPF is widely used in power system
control and since it runs often, sometimes every 30 seconds [7],
an undetected cyberattack on data supplied to the OPF program
could cause power to be dispatched erroneously. Network configuration,
generator capacity and system loads are some of the
data input to the OPF program that could be maliciously modified
by an adversary through unauthorized access or the introduction
of malicious code.
In this paper we develop an algorithm that uses principal component
analysis (PCA) to determine whether input data passed
to the OPF software module has been contaminated by cyberterrorists.
The algorithm computes an orthogonal linear transformation
of output data and splits the resulting space into two
subspaces-regular and irregular, separating the output data's
variability into normal and anomalous variability. Normal variability
is described as naturally occurring and inherent to the
process while anomalous variability is unnatural and due to a
shock or disruption to the process. An anomaly is detected if
the summed square of the data mapped onto the irregular subspace
exceeds a statistical threshold. PCA has been used in the
detection of anomalies in security considerations in communication
networks [8], [9], but to our knowledge, not for detecting
data anomalies in the power industry.
The PCA-based algorithm presented in this paper is customized
to determine if input data related to transmission lines
has been compromised. In doing so, the algorithm monitors
the real power flow output from OPF. The orthogonal linear
transformation model is obtained from historical OPF outputs
(real power flows), which are computed under normal operating
conditions. While our algorithm analyzes real power flows and
detects anomalies in transmission line parameters, it is possible
to monitor a different OPF output and detect cyberintrusion in
different input data. In this case, a different customization of
the algorithm is necessary.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:
Section III documents recent research in intrusion detection
in power system operations; Section IV describes the power
system model; Section V explains the anomaly detection model
and assumptions; Section VI provides numerical results for two
test power systems; and Section VII reports our conclusions.
II. RELATED WORK
Recent research in power system security has focused entirely
on cyberintrusion related to intelligent electronic devices (IEDs)
like remote terminal units (RTUs), phasor measurement units
(PMUs) and meters. These attacks are referred to as malicious
data injection attacks. Our research defines a new class of cyberattacks
to power systems-malicious modification of network

data stored in an accessible database-which is different from
the research on malicious data injection attacks.
An important module in the modern power control system,
the state estimation program uses the measurements from IEDs
to estimate state variables like voltage angles and magnitudes at
each bus in a power system. Statistical techniques successfully
identify and remove obvious bad data from state estimation procedures.
And, since state estimation cleans the data, this process
also prevents the bad data from being stored in databases for future
use.
Bad data detection methods were included in the first state estimation
programs in the late 1960s and were designed to detect
large errors that were the result of equipment malfunction [10].
The methods have been enhanced over the years [11], [12], but
remain much the same as when first implemented in the latter
half of the twentieth century.
Recently, more consideration has been placed on detecting
data errors intentionally injected into the power system through
telemetered data. These errors will likely not be detectable
through state estimation by commonly used methods like least
normalized residuals (LNR). The false data are designed to
be undetectable. An intruder could craftily design an attack to
inject bad data in a way that would optimize damage to the
power system while minimizing detection.
Liu et al., in [13], described a new class of cyberattacks called
false data injection attacks. Results of their research indicate that
it is possible by compromising meter measurements to construct
an attack vector that changes the results of state estimation and
is undetectable by commonly used methods of bad data detection
like LNR. Sensor measurement protection through the use
of network observability rules as a solution to detecting false
data injection attacks was the focus of research in [14]. To measure
the vulnerability of a network, the research in [15] defined
a security index as the minimum number of meters necessary
to perform an unobservable attack. An algorithm for such an
index that helps to locate power flows whose measurements are
potentially easy to manipulate can be found in [16] where the
authors urge the incremental deployment of protected measurements
to increase grid security. In an expansion on the research
by Liu et al., Kosut et al. proposed a detector based on the generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to detect attacks where the
adversary does not have access to a sufficient number of meters
to launch an unobservable attack. They posit that the key to defending
against such malicious data attacks is the introduction
of redundant and trustworthy measurements that ensure network
observability [17]. The financial effects of the aforementioned
false data injection attacks on electric power market operations
is studied in [18]. The most recent research on smart grid data integrity
attacks with the goal of biasing state estimation results,
focuses on strategic methods of identifying, foiling and counteracting
attacks on IEDs. In [19] unobservable, coordinated attacks
are described and strategic placement of secure PMUs are
shown to be an effective defense. The research by Kim et al. develops
an algorithm to optimize the choice of PMUs to secure
and a separate algorithm to optimize their placement [20].
Implementation of the results from the recent research is
necessary to protect the power grid; however, it is not sufficient.
Network data stored in databases is also vulnerable to
cyberattack. These cyberattacks are different from previously
researched data integrity attacks in the sense that these physical
transmission line data do not depend on the measurements
from IEDs. If a cyberattack which changed network parameters
stored in a database were to significantly alter the system state
estimate, then the alarm raised to the operator during bad data
detection would likely discover the parameter change. However,
situations could arise where the state estimation bad data
detection schemes would not detect malicious modification of
network data in an accessible database. For example inadequate
measurement redundancy could cause the parameter to be
undetectable [21] or the network database could be modified by
cyberattackers after the most recent state estimation program
has run and before an instance of the OPF module has run.
Our proposed method, implemented in the network topology
processing portion of the OPF module, provides an additional
security measure to protect the power grid.
III. OPF MODEL
The modern control center uses multiple instances of the
OPF module, often in real-time, to operate the power system as
economically as possible while ensuring its reliability despite
changes in load requirements and available resources. The OPF
module provides an optimal solution of flows, voltages, and
power injections either to the operator or as input to automated
generation control (AGC) programs and is commonly executed
every 3 minutes with an updated set of values for input parameters
[7]. Some of the input values, such as line characteristics
and network configuration, typically do not change over a short
period of time while others, such as load and the set of available
generators, vary more often. Therefore, the solution vector
of the OPF module changes over time based on the natural
variability in the module's input data.
We use MatPower's default primal-dual interior point solver
(MIPS) to compute AC power flows. In the standard AC OPF
model from the MatPower manual that follows [22] is the
number of buses and is the number of generators in the
network.

upon since first discussed by Carpentier in 1962 [23].
C. Objective Function For a better understanding of OPF formulations the reader is
directed to [24]-[26] and for this specific implementation, the
MatPower Manual [22].
The objective function sums the polynomial cost functions,
and of real and reactive power injections, respectively,
for each generator. We particularly focus on the OPF instance
whose objective is to find a steady state operation point which
minimizes generation cost while enforcing system performance
through limits on real and reactive power generator outputs, bus
voltage angles and magnitudes, and transmission line flows.

IV. ANOMALY DETECTION
We generate historical flow data by coding a Monte Carlo
simulation of the power system since actual line flows are difficult
to obtain. In the simulation, we use MatPower to compute
the optimal real power flow through each branch,
for intervals under normal operating
conditions as defined in (16).
We use PCA to transform the power flow data to a new set
of axes called principal components. In the transformation, the
resulting principal components are ordered so that the first one
accounts for as much of the variability in the original data as
possible. Each subsequent principal component accounts for as
much of the remaining variability as possible. The th principal
component accounts for the least amount of variability.
Using this property of principal components, we separate the
results into two subspaces-regular and irregular. We map the
output to be analyzed onto the irregular subspace to discover the
time at which a cyberattack led to abnormal power flows.
In the remainder of this section we define the principal components
and explain the process of separating the anomalous
flows from the normal flows through the use of subspaces.
A. Principal Component Analysis
PCA is a powerful multivariate analysis technique used extensively
in the social sciences to reduce the dimensionality of
data and more recently in such fields as facial recognition and
image compression. It was first documented by Pearson in 1901
[27] and developed independently by Hotelling in 1933 [28].
While its use as a dimension reduction tool is well documented,
PCA is also one of the best-known statistical methods for identifying
anomalies in communication network traffic [29]. This
type of anomaly identification application is also known as outlier
detection. PCA transforms a (typically) large set of correlated
variables into a set of uncorrelated variables on a new coordinate
system. These uncorrelated variables, called principal
components, are then ordered so that the first few principal components
contain most of the variability in all of the original set
of variables while maintaining as much information as possible
from the original data.
1) Definition of Principal Components: Principal components
are the orthogonal axes formed when PCA is applied to
a set of data. Each of the principal components points in the
direction of maximum variance remaining in the data, given
the variance already accounted for by the previous principal
components.
We start by standardizing the real power flow vectors :

In this paper we assume that a cyberterrorist has compromised
the integrity of network data stored in an accessible database
and, unknown to the operator, input to the OPF module
affecting the real power flows is erroneous. The real power flow

calculated according to the following equation [21]:

where is the sample mean of the real power flow through
transmission line and is the sample standard deviation of the
same flow. We apply PCA to the standardized power flow matrix,
, which is made up of column vectors, , of real power
flow measurements. We are interested in the variances and structure
of covariances among the flows in the time series.
PCA is an iterative process that in step 1 looks for a linear
function of the elements of

coefficients. Each column of is an eigenvector of the sample
covariance matrix, , corresponding to its th largest eigenvalue
and contains the coefficients for one principal component.
Since for each column of is the variance
of the th column of .
The coefficients, , are referred to as loadings since they are
the weights by which the original data elements are multiplied
when calculating the principal components. Each in (18)
is a score and a principal component is the sum of all of the
scores for one column of loadings.
2) Derivation of Principal Components: Derivation of the
principal components can be accomplished in different ways.
We include here the derivation using singular value decomposition
(SVD) since it gives an efficient practical method of
computation.
Given a matrix of observations on real power flows
measured about their means and using a key result of matrix algebra,
SVD, can be written as
B. Tunable Parameters
In many applications of PCA, the first few components are
used for analysis since the majority of variability in the entire
original dataset is often concentrated in these first few (principal)
components. Our solution uses the set of components containing
the least amount of variability which we refer to as the
minor components and two tunable parameters are key to successful
analysis: is the number of minor components used to
determine the size of the irregular subspace and is the detection
threshold used to detect anomalies. Since the value of these
parameters is network sensitive, the trial and error approach we
use for determination is only necessary once for a particular network
configuration and can be accomplished offline. The operator
may choose to adjust the threshold, , if the number of false
alarms changes significantly over time.
1) Choosing : Recent research on the use of subspaces in
the analysis of traffic anomalies in communication network data
documented three methods of choosing the size of the regular
subspace: sighting the knee of a scree plot of cumulative variance
accounted for by principal components, specifying a percentage
of the same cumulative variance, and using from the
mean [9]. These methods are often used when reducing dimensionality,
but the authors in [29] concluded that none of them
was a failsafe method for anomaly detection. In [30], Jolliffe
discussed some of the same methods and also stressed the value
of the minor components in certain types of outlier detection.
Outliers which are not obvious from analysis of the original
variables individually may be detected using the minor components.
Because of the relationships among the power flows in
transmission lines, we focus on the minor components and experimentally
choose the value of that in combination with
results in the most detected anomalies with the least number of
false alarms.
2) Choosing : The second tunable parameter , the detection
threshold, is used to detect anomalies. Through experimentation
we increase and decrease for various values of K until
the percentage of true anomalies detected is high and the number
of false anomalies detected is low.

A complete discussion of PCA and the derivation of the principal
components can be found in [30].
After carefully choosing , we separate the matrix into
matrix with orthonormal columns so that two sub-spaces, regular and irregular. The coefficient vectors
associated with the minor components (which capture the
matrix with orthonormal columns so that least variability) form , the irregular subspace. The
coefficient vectors associated with the principal components
(which capture the most variability) form , the regular
subspace. Since we use historical data under normal operating
conditions as input to PCA the majority of the variability
in the output from PCA can be attributed to naturally occurring
phenomena like time of day and weather. Consequently,
we define variability associated with the subspace as normal
variability and variability associated with the subspace as
anomalous variability. Note that the use of PCA subspaces for
detecting anomalies is well-documented and we refer the reader
to Jolliffe's text [30] for the related mathematical proofs.
VALENZUELA et al.: REAL-TIME INTRUSION DETECTION IN POWER SYSTEM OPERATIONS

D. Detection Model
To analyze the power flows in the new coordinate space, we
create the scores vectors, , by multiplying the original standardized
data by the loadings in the irregular subspace
In this process we ignore the normal variability and analyze
to discover any anomalous variability which may be related
to maliciously modified input data.
To detect anomalies, we compute the sum of the squared
terms of the scores of the minor components:
Because should be small given most of the variability
has been removed from this subspace, we conclude that no evidence
of anomalous variability exists if , and therefore
the power system is considered to be in control. If an anomaly is
found, we regenerate the historical flows over the interval from
to and repeat the analysis.
This periodic regeneration of the historical flows re-calibrates
the model to a relatively current time period. In a real-time implementation
the algorithm would run in conjunction with an
OPF module and use the latest power flow data as historical data
on which to base the PCA. The regeneration of the historical
data in our case studies emulates the real-time implementation
by using the 168 hours of historical data immediately prior to
the last anomaly encountered.

V. CASE STUDIES
To test the effectiveness of our detection algorithm, we introduce
anomalies into a transmission system at a point in time
and analyze the results. For our case studies, we use data from
the IEEE Reliability Test System [31]. We run our simulation
on both the 24-bus system and the 118-bus system. The 24-bus
system consists of 38 transmission lines, 24 buses of which 17
have loads, and 33 generators. The 118-bus system has 186
transmission lines, 118 buses of which 99 have loads, and 54
generators. Because of the large amount of data related to these
systems, we refer the reader to [22] and [31] for additional
details.
As documented earlier in this paper, no known cyberattacks
have been carried out on the U.S. transmission network so it is
difficult to identify a typical attack. We choose line characteristics
to change in the cases described below because this data
is accessible, affects the calculation of optimal power flows and
changes to line characteristics may not be detected by a system
operator. In three of the five cases, the attacks are defined randomly.
In lieu of a typical attack, this use of randomness in selecting
the parameters to change, the amount of change, and the
lines to change provides a range of scenarios and tests the effectiveness
of the algorithm at various levels of severity.
For each system we run five cases, A-E. In Case A, we run
the experiment with each line (one at a time) removed from service.
In the rest of the experiments we change the values of line
characteristics using a randomly generated factor, , between .1

and 1.9, excluding the value 1. For each modification, a new is
generated. To test multiple attacks on a single line, in Case B we
randomly choose two characteristics on the same line-resistance,
reactance, line charging susceptance or MVA rating and
modify the value of each characteristic by . Line characteristic
values are independent since our algorithm modifies the value
stored in the database and the OPF module performs its calculations
directly from the data in the database. Cases C, D and E
are designed to test attacks on multiple lines at the same time.
In Case C we randomly select two lines, change reactance on
the first line and MVA rating on the second line. Case D tests
a three line attack. We randomly select three lines, change reactance
on the first line, MVA rating on the second line and resistance
on the third line. And finally, Case E tests a four line
attack. Four lines are randomly selected, reactance is changed
on the first line, MVA rating on the second line, resistance on
the third line and on the fourth line, either the MVA rating is
changed or the line is removed from service. Table I summarizes
the case descriptions.
Using actual data from the PJM [32], a standardized load profile
of 744 hours is created by scaling down the load data so the
value 1.0 corresponds to the peak load in the data. Fig. 2 is a plot
of the standardized load. The load at each hour is calculated by
applying the load profile to the load supplied by the IEEE test
systems at each bus (where there is load). Although the load at
each bus follows the same-time variability pattern, the actual
values are distinct at different buses.
The design parameters, and , are dependent on the data
being analyzed. For each of the test systems we carefully choose

the parameters to ensure that cyberattacks of all severity are
discovered and false alarms are not a problem for the operator.
We run the Monte Carlo simulation for 168 hours (1/4 of the
total profile) to generate historical power flows. We refresh the
historical data dynamically with for 168
hours when an anomaly is detected throughout each of the case
studies. In the simulation, generator failures are sampled according
to a continuous-time two-state Markov chain [31]. In
Fig. 3 notice the variations in the plotted power flows on four of
the lines in the 24-bus system.
In all cases we use PCA to derive an orthogonal basis set and
form two subspaces, and . is the subspace
which contains most of the system's variability. We perform our
analysis with the subspace where the least amount of
system variability is captured. We map the flow observations,
into the subspace, using (20) and simulate the system.
To study the performance of the detection approach for each
case study we run our simulation for 576 hours under regular
operating conditions that include load variability and generator
outages. At hour 577 we represent a cyberattack by introducing
an anomaly prior to running the OPF module.
We define the severity of an attack as the overall amount of
change that is introduced to the system by the anomaly. The
severity level of each change is based on the factor, , that is
applied to the line characteristic. A low severity level 1 corresponds
to a factor of .9 (reduce the value of the line characteristic
by 10%) or 1.1 (increase the value of the line characteristic by
10%) and a high severity level 9 corresponds to a factor of .1 (reduce
the value of the line characteristic by 90%) or 1.9 (increase
the value of the line characteristic by 90%). Other severity levels
relate in the same way. The severity level of an attack is the sum
of the severity levels for each change in the attack.
Because we sum the severity levels when multiple lines are
attacked and in each case a different number of lines are attacked,
we define severity classes to better aggregate the large
amount of data. In Table II we introduce five severity classes
and show how the severity levels are aggregated among them.

MatPower for the 24-bus system. Line 11 is the only line with a
factor of 0 for every line to line relationship. The LODF sensitivity
analysis is an indication that line 11 is unaffected by
changes to and outages in other lines in the system. Line 11 is
a radial line connecting generator bus 7 (three generators and
customer load) to load bus 8. Because line 11 provides the only
source of power to the substation serving customers at bus 7, its
power flow will be unaffected by changes in other lines and all
results using this system are calculated with line 11 eliminated
from the calculations.
The best results occur with and where
we detect 37 of 37 introduced anomalies when the reactance
is decreased by 80% , 35 of 37 introduced anomalies
when the reactance is decreased by 20% , and 37 of 37
introduced anomalies when the reactance is increased by 50%
with only 3 false alarms. Increasing to .00004 and
keeping detects fewer introduced anomalies overall
and results in the same number of false alarms while decreasing
to .00002 and keeping detects more introduced anomalies,
but results in 6 false alarms.
The scree plot in Fig. 4 shows the cumulative variance captured
by each principal component. The first 9 components,
where , contain 99.996% of the variance in the
power flow data so any choice of will concentrate very
close to 100% of the normal variability in the principal components
formed by the regular subspace, . Since our algorithm
detects anomalies (outliers) in the power flow data, we focus on
the minor components that contain the least amount of variance.
Choosing we capture 100% of the normal variability
in the principal components formed by subspace, . Hence,

2) Experimental Results: Results from Cases A and B are
summarized in Table IV and results from Cases C, D, and E in
Table V. The last row of Table V reports the overall percentage
of anomaly detections for Cases C, D, and E.
In Case A the experiment is run a total of 38 times, once with
each line (one at a time) removed from service. When either
line 10 or line 11 is removed from service the OPF does not
converge. Line 10 connects bus 6 to bus 10. Line 11 connects
bus 7 to bus 8 and is a radial line, providing the only source
of power to bus 7. For reporting purposes the situation where
the OPF does not converge is considered a detection since the
operator would be alerted. The introduced anomalies in Case A
are detected 100% of the time.
In Case B where we test two changes on a single line, we
again run the experiment once for each line for a total of 38
times. We detect the introduced anomaly on all but seven lines
or 84% of the time. Detection is influenced both by the size
of the change factor, , and the characteristic that is modified.
For example changes to line 1 are not detected when resistance
is increased by 70% and line charging susceptance is increased
by 50% (note that the value of resistance is independent
from the value of line charging susceptance here since the OPF
module reads the changed values from the database directly).

But changes to line 4, when MVA rating is decreased by 30%
and reactance is increased by 20%, are detected.
To further test our algorithm, we perform three additional experiments
in Cases C, D and E and run each experiment 1000
times. The severity class of each anomaly is measured as described
previously.
In Case C we randomly modify two lines at one time. In the
1000 repetitions 97% of the anomalies are detected and all of the
anomalies representing the severest attacks are detected. Among
the anomalies not detected are one where in line 8 the MVA
rating is reduced by 70% (severity 3) and in line 4 the reactance
is reduced by 10% (severity 1). We sum the severity levels
and from Table II we consider the anomaly to be
in severity class 2. We note that in 17 of the 18 experimental
runs where the reactance is changed on line 11 (65% of the undetected
anomalies) the combined anomaly is not detected regardless
of the amount of change introduced to the reactance.
The OPF does not converge in the 18th experiment.
In Case D we randomly modify three lines at one time. 99%
of the anomalies are detected in the 1000 repetitions and once
again all of the anomalies representing the severest attacks are
detected. Among the anomalies not detected are one repetition
where in line 8 the MVA rating is increased by 20% (severity 2),
in line 18 the reactance is increased by 20% (severity 2), and in
line 22 the resistance is reduced by 10% (severity 1) Summing
the three severities in Table II we consider
the anomaly to be in severity class 1. Line 11 is one of the three
lines in 73% of the undetected anomalies.
And, in Case E we randomly modify four lines at one time and
detect anomalies 99.5% of the time. In the two highest overall
severity levels, we detected 100% of the anomalies. Two of the
five anomalies not detected include line 11 as one of the four
lines. One of the anomalies not detected in severity class 3 was
the repetition where in line 32 the line rating was increased
by 70% (severity 7), in line 1 the reactance was increased by
20% (severity 2), in line 3 the resistance was increased by 20%
(severity 2), and in line 2 the MVA rating was reduced by 60%
(severity 6). The sum classifies the severity
as class 3.

1) Design Parameters K and : Again we run a full experiment,
changing line reactance by a factor, , ranging from
% to % on each line repeatedly for several combinations
of K and . The choice of is informed by a scree plot of
cumulative variance by principal component similar to Fig. 4.
Representative results from the experiment are documented in
Table VI and we choose and . The number
of false anomalies with this parameter selection is 10 and the
overall rate of detection is 72.8%. With we capture
100% of the normal variability in the subspace, . We perform

2) Experimental Results: Experimental Cases A, B, C, D,
and E are run in exactly the same manner as in the previous section
with results from Cases A and B summarized in Table VII
and results from Cases C, D, and E summarized in Table VIII.

detections for Cases C, D, and E.

ANOMALY DETECTION BY SEVERITY CLASS FOR 118-BUS SYSTEM
In Case A we remove a line from service, one at a time and
the system detects the removal of 97.8% of the lines. In Case B
we randomly choose two line characteristics to modify on one
line at a time. The system detects the line changes on 50% of
the lines. In Case C we randomly modify two lines. In the 1000
repetitions 74% of the anomalies are detected. The percentage
of anomalies detected increases with increasing attack severity.
Among the anomalies not detected is one repetition where in
line 18 the reactance is reduced by 90% (severity 9) and in line
184 the MVA rating is reduced by 60% (severity 6). Summed
severities put this anomaly in severity class 4.
In Case D we randomly modify three lines and 82% of
the anomalies are detected in the 1000 repetitions. In the one
anomaly not detected in the highest overall severity level of 5
the MVA rating in line 74 is increased by 80%, in line 79 the
reactance is increased by 90%, and in line 171 the resistance is
increased by 90%.
And, in Case E we randomly modify four lines and detect
anomalies 99.6% of the time. The two anomalies not detected
in this experiment are both in severity class 2. In the first one,
the MVA rating in line 42 is increased by 50%, in line 12 the
reactance is increased by 20%, in line 143 the resistance is increased
by 20%, and in line 152 the MVA rating is reduced by
40%. In the second one, the MVA rating in line 148 is increased
by 30%, in line 50 the reactance is reduced by 40%, in line 7
the resistance is reduced by 40%, and in line 6 the MVA rating
is reduced by 10%.

VI. CONCLUSION
Sophisticated cyberterrorists will have sufficient technical
computer and power system knowledge to devise an attack
through the Internet which could compromise the power grid.
In this paper we described a new class of cyberattacks to power
systems-malicious modification of network data stored in an
accessible database. We developed an algorithm that uses the
results of principal component analysis to detect data anomalies
resulting from this new class of attack.
We evaluated our algorithm by changing parameters associated
with transmission lines in the power system and analyzing
the resulting optimal power flows across two test systems. In
our experiments we emulated an intruder and changed multiple
parameters for a single transmission line as well as parameters
for two, three, and four transmission lines. The algorithm was
successful in detecting introduced anomalies at various severity
levels with a small number of false alarms. While the algorithm
was more successful in the 24-bus system than in the larger 118
bus system, in both systems the most severe anomalies were detectable
over 88% of the time.
Engineers, system operators and government officials know
that cybercrime prevention is not sufficient to protect the power
grid and just as BDD in state estimation focuses on detection,
additional detection algorithms strategically placed in the systems
that manage the grid will certainly increase its reliability.
Encouraged by the results from testing our algorithm, we believe
that additional testing on larger systems using industryprovided
data will demonstrate the value of implementing it in
the network topology processing portion of the OPF module to
improve database security in the power grid. Our new algorithm
adds a dimension of protection for power systems that has not
previously been addressed in the literature.
