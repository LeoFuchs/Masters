An Infrastructure Modelling Tool for Cloud Provisioning. Cloud computing offers computing, network, and storage capabilities through services that abstract the capabilities of the underlying hardware. Currently, a variety of tools exist that manage the infrastructure provisioning and use scripts to define the final state of the hardware to be deployed in the cloud. However, there are major challenges that need to be addressed to automate the infrastructure management so that they are effectively used in initiatives such as DevOps. In particular, the management of Infrastructure as a Code (IaC) is one of the most important technical challenges to support activities such as the integration, deployment, and continuous delivery of applications. To address this problem, we present a support for the management of DevOps tools, through the definition of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) based on the concept of Infrastructure as a Code, and a tool that supports this language allowing to model the final state of a provisioning infrastructure in the cloud and generating the provisioning scripts for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform. The proposed tool reduces the work for development and operations personnel and facilitates their communication.
